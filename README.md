The fitness industry has been booming over the past few years, with more people
looking to improve their overall health and well-being. To help users monitor their physical
activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle, our team has developed a Python program called
CALORY.
CALORY is a user-friendly system that enables users to track their fitness goals, monitor
nutrition intake, and create a comprehensive fitness plan that meets their individual needs. The
program is created using Python 3.8 and is connected to a MySQL database called 'calory_db'
through the MySQL connector.
The user starts by inputting their personal details such as their name, age, sex, height, and
weight. Based on this information, the program calculates the user's BMI and maintenance
calories, and the user is classified into one of three categories: normal, underweight, or
overweight. These details are then stored in a table called 'user' within the MySQL database.
If the user wants to lose weight, the program asks them to input their weekly weight loss goals,
such as 0.25 kg/week, 0.5 kg/week, 0.75 kg/week, or 1 kg/week. Based on this information, the
program calculates the daily calorie intake required to meet the user's needs, taking into account
any physical activity that the user is partaking in.
If the user wants to gain weight, they are required to input their weekly weight gain goals, and
once again, the program calculates the daily calorie intake needed to meet their requirements.
In addition to providing users with their personalized fitness plans, the program also allows users
to maintain a food and exercise diary. Users can log their meals in terms of calories, proteins, and
carbs, and the program will analyze their food intake and exercise trends, allowing them to make
necessary improvements to their overall health and fitness goals.
By using CALORY, users can track their progress, stay motivated, and achieve their fitness
goals. The program's data can also be used by fitness professionals, researchers, and other
stakeholders in the fitness industry to gain insights into user behavior and trends, ultimately
leading to more effective and personalized fitness solutions.
